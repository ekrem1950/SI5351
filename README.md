# Multipurpose signal generator with SI5351

It is a multipurpose signal generator controlled by Arduino. This project uses the SI5351 from Silicon Labs.


## Preface

The Si5351 is an I2C configurable clock generator that is very appropriate for many electronic projects. It is also a great device for replacing crystal oscillators. This project uses a version of SI5351 that has three signal outputs that can vary from 8Hz to 160Mhz. These outputs, can give you three distinct frequencies running at the same time. A great feature of the Si5351A is the possibility of using it with a microcontroller or platform like Arduino, PIC family and others. This small project is about a multipurpose signal generator controlled by Arduino. For more information about SI5351A see [Si5351A/B/C-B  I2C-PROGRAMMABLE ANY-FREQUENCY CMOS CLOCKGENERATOR + VCXO](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/Si5351-B.pdf).

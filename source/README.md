Arduino Sketch to control the SI5351 device.

The user interface of this generator consists of three push buttons and an encoder. One of that push buttons comes with the encoder device. 

Pressing the encoder pushbutton, you can select the current control (Step, Favorite frequencies or output clock). By pressing de left or right push buttons, you can select the parameter you want for each kind of control. The display will show you the current status of the signal generator.
